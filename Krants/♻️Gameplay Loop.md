    - There are 3 stages of damage for the VR Players, all being triggered by a cannon ball hitting the VR Players head.    
    
    - The VR Players can go back in damage stage by reattaching their fallen off hand (by bringing their stump (Raw XR Controller Position) to their detached hand), but lose once they reach stage 3 (head explosionðŸ¤¯)    
    
    - Stage 1
        - One random hand falls off    
    
    - Stage 2
        - The other hand falls off    
    
    - Stage 3
        - Head explodes ðŸ¤¯ causing PC Players to win.        
        *Whether or not just 1 or all VR Players must die for a PC Player victory should be a setting in the pregame lobby, set to 1 by default*

        - Can have up to 3 extra lives saved up
            - Configurable in the pregame lobby
        
        - Lives are gained by eating cheese

                - Between 2-5 plates are scattered around the map
                    - There should always be more plates than VR Players, so that the VR Players cannot guard a plate with their full attention
                
            - Cheese is gained by approaching plates and drawing 5 random shapes that are prompted
