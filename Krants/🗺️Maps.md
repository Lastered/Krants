All maps should be enclosed to prevent the losing of important props (such as VR Player decapitated hands)
## 📜Required Props
- 🌲Trees / Similar
    - Objects which are scattered around the map, only grabbable by VR Players and take time to pull out of the ground   

- 🪨Rocks
    - Both PC and VR Players can grab these    
    
    - Size variations    

- 🍽 Plates
    - 2-5 plates scattered throughout each map
        - Recommended to always have more plates than VR Players to split VR Players attention between multiple areas     

- 🔫Cannons
    - Cannons automatically face the nearest VR Players head
    
    - Cannon balls do not track VR Players head, rather continue in the trajectory they were fired
    
    - 2-5 cannons scattered throughout each map
        - Recommended to always match or have more cannons to VR Players to balance gameplay

## ⛰Terrain Elements
- 🌾Open Areas
    - At least 1/3 of the map should be open areas (with trees and props)
    
    - Open areas are specifically for VR Players
        - VR Players in enclosed spaces lose immersion through imprecise hand movement, inaccurate player movement, and restricted virtual head movement

- 📏Taller Areas
    - Areas taller than the VR Players eyeline at standing height
        - Not recommended to go anymore above that
        
    - Should never contain goal props such as plates or cannons
        - If PC Players can progress without the VR Player having the chance to comfortably or safely (physically) reach them it leads to frustration on the VR Players side

- 🏚️Enclosed / Tight Spaces
    - At least 1/5 of the map should include spaces where only PC Players can fit
        - Since the PC Players body is as large as a VR Players hand, the VR Players hand can still swipe this area, but is less accessible
        
        - Less "swipe-able" areas can be created by making the enclosed space deeper, causing the VR Player to have to reach in to swipe any PC Players inside
    - Placing plates inside enclosed spaces is not recommended
    
    - Placing cannons inside an enclosed space is allowed
        - Limit the cannons inside an enclosed space to 1 per VR Player at max

## 🧨Special Level Elements
- Capture point
    - When 1 or more PC Players stand in a designated area for 15 seconds 3 pieces of cheese spawn
        - Recommended to place in open areas
        
        - Like Fortnite capture point
